### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of InsureBook.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes `Main` and `MainApp`) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

*   [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of InsureBook.
*   [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
*   [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of InsureBook in memory.
*   [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

*   defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
*   implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `RenewalsTable`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

*   executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
*   listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
*   keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
*   depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Policy` objects residing in the `Model`.

#### Person Card UI

The person card UI is implemented using the following components:

*   `PersonListCard.fxml`: Defines the layout of each person card, including:
    *   Name and ID
    *   Contact information (phone, email, address)
    *   Tags

*   `PersonCard.java`: Controls the display of person information in the card:
    *   Binds UI elements to person data
    *   Manages tag display

#### Person Details UI

*   `PersonDetailPanel.fxml`: Defines the layout of the display for a person's details, including:
    *   Policy Number
    *   Renewal Date
    *   Policy Type
    *   Notes

*   `PersonDetailPanel.java`: Controls the display and updating of information of current selected person:
    *   Binds UI elements (labels for policy number, renewal date, and notes) to the underlying person data model
    *   Formats the renewal date display with the prefix "Renewal date: " for clarity
    *   Dynamically updates the panel's content when a different person is selected in the main list
    *   Ensures that the Notes field, if it contains a lengthy string, wraps onto multiple lines without expanding the panel's width beyond its allocated space


The person card provides a compact view of all essential client information, making it easy for insurance agents to quickly access client details and track policy renewals. The renewal date is prominently displayed with a clear label to help agents quickly identify when policies need to be renewed.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

*   When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
*   All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

*   stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
*   stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
*   stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
*   does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

*   can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
*   inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
*   depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Policy Renewal Feature

The policy renewal feature allows insurance agents to track and manage policy renewals for their clients. It is implemented using the following components:

#### Policy Class

The `Policy` class represents an insurance policy and contains:

*   Policy number (in format POL-XXX)
*   Renewal date
*   Methods to calculate days until renewal

#### ViewRenewalsCommand

The `ViewRenewalsCommand` allows users to view policies due for renewal within a specified number of days:

*   Takes a parameter for number of days (1-365)
*   Optional sort parameter (by name or date)
*   Filters the person list based on policy renewal dates
*   Updates the UI to show filtered results

#### Implementation

The renewal tracking mechanism is facilitated by the `Policy` class and the `ViewRenewalsCommand`. Here's how it works:

1. When a user executes `viewrenewals n/30`, the command is parsed by `ViewRenewalsCommandParser`.
1. The parser validates the days parameter (must be 1-365) and optional sort parameter.
1. A new `ViewRenewalsCommand` is created with the validated parameters.
1. When executed, the command:
    * Filters the person list to include only those with policies due within the specified days
    * Updates the model's filtered person list
    * Updates the renewals table in the UI
    * Returns a command result with the number of matching entries

The following sequence diagram shows how the viewrenewals operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/ViewRenewalsSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to calculate renewal due dates**

*   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculate days until renewal on demand

    *   Pros: More memory efficient
    *   Cons: May impact performance if calculated frequently

*   **Alternative 2:** Store days until renewal as a field
    *   Pros: Faster retrieval
    *   Cons: Needs to be updated daily

**Aspect: Where to implement filtering logic**

*   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** In the command

    *   Pros: Keeps filtering logic with the command that needs it
    *   Cons: Logic might be duplicated if needed elsewhere

*   **Alternative 2:** In the Model
    *   Pros: Centralizes filtering logic
    *   Cons: Makes Model more complex

### Renewal Date Update Feature

The renewal date update feature allows insurance agents to directly update a client's policy renewal date by specifying the policy number, without needing to find the client's index in the list. This feature streamlines the renewal date management process.

#### Implementation

The renewal date update functionality is implemented through the `RenewCommand` class, which follows the command pattern used throughout the application. The feature is primarily made up of the following components:

1. `RenewCommand` - Executes the updating of a renewal date for a client with a specific policy number
1. `RenewCommandParser` - Parses and validates the user input into a RenewCommand object

The following class diagram shows the structure of the Renew Command:

<puml src="diagrams/RenewCommandClassDiagram.puml" width="400"/>

The feature works through the following process flow:

1. The user enters a command in the format `renew pol/POLICY_NUMBER r/RENEWAL_DATE`.
1. The `LogicManager` passes the command string to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` identifies the command as a `renew` command and delegates to `RenewCommandParser`.
1. `RenewCommandParser` extracts and validates:
    * Policy number (must be a valid policy number format)
    * Renewal date (must be a valid date in DD-MM-YYYY format)
1. `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method of the command object.
1. The `RenewCommand`:
    * Filters the list of persons to find those with the specified policy number
    * Validates that exactly one match is found (not zero, not multiple)
    * Creates a new `Person` with the updated renewal date while preserving other fields (including policy type)
    * Updates the model with the new `Person` object
    * Returns a `CommandResult` with a success message

The following sequence diagram shows how the renew operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/RenewSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to identify the client to update:**

*   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use policy number as identifier.

    *   Pros: More intuitive for insurance agents who often reference clients by policy number.
    *   Cons: Requires handling cases where multiple clients have the same policy number.

*   **Alternative 2:** Use client index in the displayed list.
    *   Pros: Consistent with other commands like `edit` and `delete`.
    *   Cons: Less convenient as agents need to find the index first.

**Aspect: Error handling for duplicate policy numbers:**

*   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show error and suggest using `edit` command.

    *   Pros: Prevents unintended updates to the wrong client.
    *   Cons: Less convenient when there are duplicate policy numbers.

*   **Alternative 2:** Update all clients with matching policy numbers.
    *   Pros: More convenient if updating all matching policies is the intended action.
    *   Cons: High risk of unintended updates; insurance operations generally require precision.

### Find Persons Feature

The `FindCommand` allows users to search for persons in the address book by specifying various attributes. This feature is enhanced to support searching across all person attributes, providing a flexible and comprehensive search capability.

#### FindCommand

The `FindCommand` enables users to search for persons based on any attribute, such as name, address, phone number, email, tags or policy number. It is implemented using the following components:

* `FindCommand`: Executes the search operation.
* `FindCommandParser`: Parses and validates the user input into a FindCommand object.
* `FindPersonPredicate`: A predicate that evaluates whether a person matches the search criteria.

#### FindPersonPredicate

The `FindPersonPredicate` class is responsible for evaluating whether a person matches the search criteria. It is implemented as follows:

Attributes: The predicate stores the search criteria for each attribute in their own predicate object.
Evaluation:
* The `test` method checks if a person matches the search criteria by evaluating each attribute.
* It supports partial matches and is case-insensitive.
* For each attribute, it checks if the person's attribute contains the search value.

The following class diagram shows the structure of the FindPersonPredicate:
<puml src="diagrams/FindPersonPredicateClassDiagram.puml" width="500"/>

The following partial sequence diagram shows how the test operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/FindPersonPredicateSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

#### Design Considerations

* Aspect: How to handle multiple search criteria

  * Alternative 1 (current choice): Combine all criteria using logical OR.
    * Pros: Ensures that a person is considered a match if any of the specified attributes match, providing more flexible search results.
    * Cons: May result in more matches if multiple criteria are specified.
  * Alternative 2: Use logical AND to require all criteria to match.
    * Pros: Ensures that all specified attributes must match, providing precise search results.
    * Cons: May result in fewer matches if multiple criteria are specified.

* Aspect: Case sensitivity and partial matches

  * Alternative 1 (current choice): Use case-insensitive and partial matches.
    * Pros: More user-friendly and flexible, accommodating various input styles.
    * Cons: May result in unintended matches if search values are too general.
  * Alternative 2: Case-sensitive with exact matches
    * Pros: Highest precision in search results, ideal for technical/specialized searches and minimizes irrelevant matches
    * Cons: Most restrictive option for users, steeper learning curve and requires perfect knowledge of stored data format

### Filter Command

The `filter` command allows users to view policies due for renewal within a specified date range. This helps agents proactively manage upcoming renewals.

*   Takes two parameters, startDate and endDate to specify the date range
*   Optional sort parameter (by date or name); defaults to date
*   Filters the person list based on policy renewal dates
*   Updates the UI to show filtered results, and the filter specified when calling this command

#### Implementation

* `FilterDateCommand`: Executes the filtering and sorting of clients based on the provided date range and sort order.
* `FilterDateCommandParser`: Parses and validates the user input into a FilterCommand object.

The following class diagram shows how the filter command updates the UI:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterDateCommandClassDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter command works:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterDateCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

#### Design Considerations

* Aspect: Sort Order Options

* Current Choice: Accept only date or name as valid sort orders, case-insensitive. Defaults to date when not specified.
  * Pros: Simple and supports the most common use cases.
  * Cons: Doesn't support complex custom sorting (e.g., by policy number or tags).
* Alternative: Expand to include additional sort fields.
  * Pros: More customization.
  * Cons: Increases complexity in command parsing and validation.

* Aspect: Type for startDate and endDate

* Current Choice: Uses LocalDate for variables startDate and endDate.
    * Pros: Simple and has predefined methods.
    * Cons: Might be difficult to add custom fields or methods.
* Alternative: Use RenewalDate class.
    * Pros: More customization.
    * Cons: Increases coupling with the Renewal Date class which may not be tailored for the specific needs of the FilterDateCommand.

### Policy Type Feature

#### Current Implementation

The policy type feature enhances the insurance management capabilities of the application by allowing users to categorize policies into specific types (Life, Health, Property, Vehicle, and Travel). This helps insurance agents quickly identify and manage different types of policies.

The implementation consists of the following key components:

1. **`PolicyType` Enum** - Defines the available policy types and provides utilities for validation and conversion.

    ```java
    public enum PolicyType {
        LIFE, HEALTH, PROPERTY, VEHICLE, TRAVEL;

        public static PolicyType fromString(String type) { ... }
        public static boolean isValidPolicyType(String test) { ... }
    }
    ```

1. **`Policy` Class Extension** - The existing `Policy` class has been enhanced to include a `PolicyType` field.

    ```java
    public class Policy {
        // Existing fields
        public final String policyNumber;
        public final RenewalDate renewalDate;
        // New field
        private final PolicyType type;

        // Constructors that handle policy type
        public Policy(String policyNumber, String renewalDate, String type) { ... }

        // Getter for policy type
        public PolicyType getType() { ... }
    }
    ```

1. **Command Parsers** - The parsers for `AddCommand`, `EditCommand`, and `FindCommand` have been updated to recognize and process the policy type prefix (`pt/`).

1. **UI Components** - The `PersonCard` and `RenewalsTable` UI components have been modified to display the policy type.

1. **Predicate for Searching** - A `PolicyTypeContainsKeywordsPredicate` class has been added to support searching by policy type.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Implementation of Policy Types**

*   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an enumeration to represent policy types.

    *   Pros: Type safety, easy validation, prevents invalid policy types.
    *   Cons: Less flexible if new types need to be added (requires code changes).

*   **Alternative 2:** Use a string field without constraints.
    *   Pros: More flexible, users can add any type they want.
    *   Cons: Less type safety, harder to validate, potential for inconsistent data (e.g., "Health" vs "health").

**Aspect: Storage of Policy Type**

*   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store as part of the Policy object.

    *   Pros: Logical grouping, keeps policy information together.
    *   Cons: Increases complexity of the Policy class.

*   **Alternative 2:** Store as a separate field in the Person object.
    *   Pros: Simpler Policy class.
    *   Cons: Less logical grouping, policy information is split between different attributes.

#### Example Usage

The following sequence diagram shows how adding a person with a policy type works:

<puml src="diagrams/AddPersonWithPolicyTypeSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

When the user adds a new person with a policy type:

1. The `AddCommandParser` parses the command including the policy type prefix.
2. A new `Policy` object is created with the specified policy type.
3. This `Policy` is included in the new `Person` object.
4. The Model stores the new person and returns success.
5. A `CommandResult` is returned to indicate success.

The UI components will automatically update to reflect the changes in the Model.

### Glossary

-   **Insurance Agent**: The primary user of InsureBook: someone who manages and tracks client details, insurance policies, and renewals.
-   **Client**: An individual whose information is stored in InsureBook. This includes their name, contact details, address, associated policies, and optional notes or tags.
-   **Policy**: An insurance agreement linked to a client, which includes details like policy number, type, and renewal date.
-   **Policy Number**: A unique numeric code that identifies a client’s insurance policy. It must be different for each policy entered.
-   **Renewal Date**: The date by which a client’s policy must be renewed to stay active. This date is managed using `renew`, `viewrenewals`, and `filter`.
-   **Policy Type**: The category of a policy. Supported types include: `Life`, `Health`, `Property`, `Vehicle`, and `Travel`.
-   **Tag**: A label added to clients for categorization or filtering purposes. For example, `t/vip`, `t/family`, or `t/lead`.
-   **User Interface (UI)**: The graphical layout and interactive components (e.g., windows, panels, forms) through which the insurance agent interacts with the system.
-   **Logic**: The system component that processes user commands by coordinating between the UI and the data model.
-   **Model**: The component that holds all the client and policy data in memory and represents the business entities.
-   **Storage**: The component responsible for reading from and writing data to disk, ensuring data persists between sessions.
-   **Command**: A typed instruction entered in the command box (e.g., `add`, `edit`, `viewrenewals`) that tells InsureBook what action to perform.
-   **Command Parser**: The module that interprets raw user input and converts it into a structured command object.
-   **Command Result**: The outcome returned after a command is executed, including success confirmations or error messages.
-   **ObservableList**: A data structure that automatically notifies the UI of changes in the model, ensuring real-time updates.
-   **Duplicate Entry**: An entry that conflicts with existing data due to matching policy number, name + email, or name + phone. These entries are rejected to maintain data accuracy.
-   **Tag**: A custom keyword used to categorize clients for sorting and filtering.
-   **Data Persistence**: The capability of the system to save client and policy data so that information is retained across sessions.
-   **Mainstream OS**: Operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Unix, and MacOS.
